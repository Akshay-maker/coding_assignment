**To calculate the distance between Two node at same level in Binary Tree**
 
Requires python 3.7.4

The project directory is as:

distance_between_nodes
|
|-----__init__.py
|-----main.py
|-----test
        |--__init__.py
        |--test_get_distance_between_nodes

Inputs:

	1. As per the problem statement, a binary tree is defined in the main.py

	2. The main.py accepts the tree as inputt with Node_1 and Node_2 values.

How to Run:

	1. From console python3 main.py, by default values are set to Node_1 = 7 and Node_2 = 1
	
	2. To change the value, modify the values of Node_1 and Node_2 in the main.py

Note: The input node values are put up in the main.py intentionally.

Output:

	1. The ouput will printed as per the node values.

Test Coverage:

	1. The test coverage report is contained in the zip file.
	
	2. The test validates the function and code coverage.

Pylint Report:
	
	1. The pylint report shows the code modularity and no syntax error.
